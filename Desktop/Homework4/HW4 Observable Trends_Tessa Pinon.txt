The following are three observable trends from the data:
1) The data shown in table, "Scores by School Size," suggests that school size may
have a negative impact on reading scores. That is, reading scores appear to be
significantly higher for smaller schools, although the way in which schools are 
binned according to size may impact the magnitude of these apparent differences.
2) There does not appear to be a correlation between spending ranges per student
and average math scores.
3) The top five performing schools were Charter schools, while the bottom performing
schools were Distritct schools.
